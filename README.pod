=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RequiresExternal - make dists require external commands

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1091003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

    [RequiresExternal]
    requires = /path/to/some/executable
    requires = executable_in_path

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Dist::Zilla|Dist::Zilla> plugin creates a test in your distribution
to check for the existence of executable commands you require.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 requires

Each C<requires> attribute should be either an absolute path to an executable
or the name of a command in the user's C<PATH> environment.  Multiple
C<requires> lines are allowed.

Example from a F<dist.ini> file:

    [RequiresExternal]
    requires = sqlplus
    requires = /usr/bin/java

This will require the program C<sqlplus> to be available somewhere in the
user's C<PATH> and the program C<java> specifically in F</usr/bin>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 gather_files

Adds a F<t/requires_external.t> test script to your distribution that checks
if each L</requires> item is executable.

=head2 metadata

Using this plugin will add L<Env::Path|Env::Path> to your distribution's
testing prerequisites since the F<t/requires_external.t> script uses that
module to look for executables in the user's C<PATH>.

L<Module::Install::External's requires_external_bin|Module::Install::External/requires_external_bin>
command.
